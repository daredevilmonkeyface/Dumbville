> I used ChatGPT to help me write and improve the Python code for this project.
> I made sure I understood what the code was doing and changed things to make it my own.
> I also used books and YouTube to learn along the way.
> I'm still learning Python, so I couldn't have done this completely on my own â€” but I had a lot of fun figuring things out. ðŸ™‚
